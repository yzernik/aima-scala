#aima-scala

Scala implementation of algorithms from [Norvig][nor] and [Russel's][rus] 
[Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition][aima]

Most implementations are untested, stay tuned as more of the codebase is covered with tests.
Otherwise, this repository exists as a resource for learning the concepts behind the algorithms 
in AIMA 3ed.
