/**
 * Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach (3rd Edition): page 92.<br>
 * <br>
 * Best-first search is an instance of the general TREE-SEARCH or GRAPH-SEARCH
 * algorithm in which a node is selected for expansion based on an evaluation
 * function, f(n). The evaluation function is construed as a cost estimate, so
 * the node with the lowest evaluation is expanded first. The implementation of
 * best-first graph search is identical to that for uniform-cost search (Figure
 * 3.14), except for the use of f instead of g to order the priority queue.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Supports both Tree and Graph based versions by using graphSearch or treeSearch as an argument
